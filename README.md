## Overview

The Drug Tracker Application is a specialized web platform designed to streamline the **pharmaceutical procurement workflow**. It enables users to efficiently manage the entire lifecycle of drug orders, starting from the bulk import of purchase lists via CSV files, to placing orders, and finally, confirming the receipt of goods.

A key feature of the system is its integration with **Telegram for real-time order notifications**, ensuring stakeholders are kept up-to-date. The application also provides a comprehensive history log for tracking and auditing all procurement activities.

Built with a robust technology stack, this application leverages the power of Vue 3 and the Vite ecosystem for a fast and reactive frontend, while utilizing Supabase for a scalable and secure backend infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Bulk Order Creation via CSV**: Easily upload a CSV file containing a list of required drugs to initiate the procurement process quickly.
*   **End-to-End Order Tracking**: Manage the complete status of orders, from 'Ordered' to 'Delivered'. A simple interface allows users to update the status upon receiving goods.
*   **Real-Time Telegram Notifications**: Automatically sends notifications to a designated Telegram channel or user when a new order is placed, keeping the team informed.
*   **Comprehensive Order History**: A dedicated history view provides a detailed log of all past and current orders, complete with statuses and timestamps, for easy tracking and auditing.
*   **Reactive Frontend**: Built with Vue 3 (Composition API) for a highly performant and maintainable user interface.
*   **Rapid Development**: Powered by Vite, offering lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build processes.
*   **Scalable Backend**: Integrated with Supabase, providing database, authentication, and storage solutions out-of-the-box.
*   **Centralized State Management**: Utilizes Pinia for predictable and debuggable state.
*   **Deployment Ready**: Comes with a pre-defined configuration for seamless deployment to Firebase Hosting.
